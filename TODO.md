# TODO: Add English and Bengali Buttons to index.html

- [x] Edit frontend/templates/index.html: Replace the language select dropdown with two buttons (English and Bengali) inside a div with class "language-buttons".
- [x] Edit frontend/static/css/style.css: Add responsive styles for .language-buttons (flex layout for centering, media queries for mobile responsiveness) and specific styles for the language buttons.
- [x] Edit frontend/static/js/app.js: Add event listeners for the buttons to dynamically set recognition.lang to "en-IN" for English and "bn-IN" for Bengali, and remove hardcoded language settings.
